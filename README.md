# few: Fast EMRI Waveforms

This package contains the highly modular framework for fast and accurate extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) waveforms from [arxiv.org/2104.04582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582) and [arxiv.org/2008.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071). The waveforms in this package combine a variety of separately accessible modules to form EMRI waveforms on both CPUs and GPUs. Generally, the modules fall into four categories: trajectory, amplitudes, summation, and utilities. Please see the [documentation](https://bhptoolkit.org/FastEMRIWaveforms/) for further information on these modules. The code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms). The data necessary for various modules in this package will automatically download the first time it is needed. If you would like to view the data, it can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3981654#.XzS_KRNKjlw). The current and all past code release zip files can also be found on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8190418). Please see the [citation](#citation) section below for information on citing FEW.

This package is a part of the [Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](https://bhptoolkit.org/).

If you use all or any parts of this code, please cite [arxiv.org/2104.04582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582) and [arxiv.org/2008.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071). See the [documentation](https://bhptoolkit.org/FastEMRIWaveforms/) to properly cite specific modules.
